# Minecraft Modding Workshop

This repository is the setup for a workshop to teach the basics of programming by creating a modification for Minecraft.
It is based on the [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod).

## Setup

### For Participants
If you want to create your own mod, but have no idea where to start, you can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cPbAFv19E) on YouTube to set everything up on your PC.
You can find more information about the Fabric Minecraft Mod in the [official wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/start).
To create textures for Minecraft you can use the [Nova Skin Editor](https://minecraft.novaskin.me/resourcepacks).

### For Instructors
If you have IntelliJ and a JDK > version 17 ready, just checkout this repository and open the `build.gradle` file as new IntelliJ project.
Gradle will automatically setup everything for you.
To run Minecraft add the run configuration `Add configuration` -> `Application` -> `Minecraft Client`.
